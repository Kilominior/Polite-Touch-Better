# Polite Touch Permitted 非诚勿触

A game developed by myself (except of some art resources, thanks to Wu my partner) with **unity 2021.3.7f1c1**.

We launched this project as a work for **ciga game jam 2023**, and it took me two weeks to finish it. Now its development is suspended indefinitely.

it has an itch page: [**Polite Touch Better on itch.io**](https://kilominior.itch.io/polite-touch-better)

### About Game

In the virtual space, we have a ***rubber man*** made of paper. There is nothing special about him, except of his ability of **grasping anything he touches**. But his body is very sensitive to external touch(YOUR Touch), any careless touch without sincerity will only cause his body parts to bounce reflexively. However, if gently comforted with sincerity, he will relax and sway freely.

**You need to bring him to the end of each level by touching him with your mouse.**

Don't forget to be polite(be gentle), have fun :)



### 游戏简介

在虚拟的空间中，存在着一只由纸片构成的***橡皮人***，橡皮人唯一的能力就是用自己的五个幻肢**紧紧抓住触及的一切**。但幻肢对外界的触碰十分敏感，没有诚意的乱碰只会让幻肢条件反射地弹开，若带着诚意，轻轻安抚，幻肢则会放松开来，自由摆荡。

**你需要用手中的鼠标触碰橡皮人的幻肢，带它到达每关的终点。**

（“真诚”点，或者说，温柔点！）



### How To Play

**You just need a mouse to play the game.**

There are two kinds of "Touch" in the game:

On ***Rude Touch Mode***, you can **touch any body part by cursor** to stimulate it into bouncing,

on ***Polite Touch Mode***, **left-click a body part** to let go, clicking the head can let go all parts of the body.

If you want to ***switch between the two modes***, just **right-click**.



### 操作说明

**本游戏只需鼠标移动以及点击即可操作。**

游戏中的触碰分为两种：

一种是会在**光标触及时**引起幻肢应激弹飞的“***无理乱碰***”，

另一种则是在**左键点击时**会让幻肢松手的“***诚意轻抚***”。

要想***切换触碰模式***，只需**按下鼠标右键**。
